# Sustainable Energy Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting global energy sustainability using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and visualization of results. The project is structured to provide insights into global sustainable energy trends and to demonstrate the application of ML models in this domain.

## Directory Structure

- `Analysis and Predicting Global Energy Sustainability Using Machine LearningYingxuan Zhang.pdf`  
  Project report and documentation (PDF).
- `UG Finnal.ipynb`  
  Main Jupyter Notebook for data analysis, modeling, and results.
- `Dataset/`  
  Contains all raw and processed data files used in the project.
- `Visualization Dashboard/`  
  Interactive dashboard for visualizing key findings and results.

## Dataset

The `Dataset` folder contains:
- Global ESG data (multiple CSV files)
- World and sustainable energy data (CSV)
- Additional data archives

## Jupyter Notebook

The notebook `UG Finnal.ipynb` includes:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Result interpretation

## Visualization Dashboard

The `Visualization Dashboard` folder provides an interactive web-based dashboard for visualizing the main results of the analysis. It includes:
- `index.html`: Main entry point for the dashboard
- `js/`, `css/`, `images/`, `font/`, `picture/`: Supporting resources for charts, styles, and images
- The dashboard uses ECharts and jQuery for dynamic data visualization

### How to Use the Dashboard
1. Open `Visualization Dashboard/index.html` in your web browser.
2. Explore the interactive charts and visual summaries of the analysis results.
3. The dashboard is self-contained and does not require a backend server.

## How to Run the Project
1. Open `UG Finnal.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run the cells step by step to reproduce the analysis and modeling.
3. Review the results and visualizations generated in the notebook.
4. For interactive visualization, use the dashboard as described above.
